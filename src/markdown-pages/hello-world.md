# Hello, world

This is my first post on the new blog. I create this blog to share my thought, skills, and things related to programming. My interested technologies now are JavaScript, React, Node, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL and TypeScript.

### Why JavaScript?

I'm a self-taught web developer. I've learnt programming for a year and now I have 2 projects (a Slack clone chat app and an e-commerce written by Node). I love JavaScript, the second programming language I learn. The first one, Pascal I was taught in high school is great but I found the applications in Pascal are limited, especially compared to JS.

At the beginning, I received an advice to got with PHP. I haven't gave it a try yet. Instead, I choose JavaScript since it is a best friend with the webs. And I love the webs.

I know there are a myriad of websites built by PHP and its related technologies (XAMPP stack). But I choose JavaScript, feel comfortable with it at the beginning, till now (a year later).

I think I will try another programming language in future. But now, you know, there are so much remain things to learn in JavaScript after a year.

That is also the reason I write blog to share my approach that I've collected and from my own.

### MERN stack, MEAN stack or something else?

I'm working with React for the front end. React is a framework launched by Facebook and it allows me do bunch of things. I love the component terminology of React.

So, should we go with MERN or MEAN or something else for our project?

As a member of a team, you and I would have some point. The answer to that question can be yes or no (with MERN stack). Sometimes, I think it would be like when I sitting in a room of the IELTS exam. Just pick one that our team are comfortable, and go.

In this case, I should concern the collectiveness, instead of the individuality. It's not like people can go to the church every Sunday, regardless of religious background. Technologies are not religion. If the case is when I build a pet project, may be I would choose MERN or challenging myself with a new one. On the other hand, I have to follow the decision of seniors and ... hope for the best.
